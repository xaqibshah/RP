    "## About Dataset\n",
    "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a menace to network security that aims at exhausting the target networks with malicious traffic. Although many statistical methods have been designed for DDoS attack detection, designing a real-time detector with low computational overhead is still one of the main concerns. On the other hand, the evaluation of new detection algorithms and techniques heavily relies on the existence of well-designed datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we first review the existing datasets comprehensively and propose a new taxonomy for DDoS attacks. Secondly, we generate a new dataset, namely CICDDoS2019, which remedies all current shortcomings. Thirdly, using the generated dataset, we propose a new detection and family classification approach based on a set of network flow features. Finally, we provide the most important feature sets to detect different types of DDoS attacks with their corresponding weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of survey studies that have proposed taxonomies with respect to DDoS attacks. Although all have done a commendable job in proposing new taxonomies, the scope of attacks has so far been limited. There is a need to identify new attacks and come up with new taxonomies. Hence, we have analyzed new attacks that can be carried out using TCP/UDP based protocols at the application layer and proposed a new taxonomy. The rest of this sub-section has been explained the detailed taxonomy of DDoS attacks and illustrated in Figure 1, in terms of reflection-based and exploitation-based attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection-based DDoS: Are those kinds of attacks in which the identity of the attacker remains hidden by utilizing legitimate third-party component. The packets are sent to reflector servers by attackers with source IP address set to target victim&rsquo;s IP address to overwhelm the victim with response packets. These attacks can be carried out through application layer protocols using transport layer protocols, i.e., Transmission control protocol (TCP), User datagram protocol (UDP) or through a combination of both. As Figure 1 shows, in this category, TCP based attacks include MSSQL, SSDP while as UDP based attacks include CharGen, NTP and TFTP. There are certain attacks that can be carried out using either TCP or UDP like DNS, LDAP, NETBIOS and SNMP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploitation-based attacks: Are those kinds of attacks in which the identity of the attacker remains hidden by utilizing legitimate third-party component. The packets are sent to reflector servers by attackers with the source IP address set to the target victim&rsquo;s IP address to overwhelm the victim with response packets. These attacks can also be carried out through application layer protocols using transport layer protocols i.e., TCP and UDP. TCP based exploitation attacks include SYN flood and UDP based attacks include UDP flood and UDP- Lag. UDP flood attack is initiated on the remote host by sending a large number of UDP packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "These UDP packets are sent to random ports on the target machine at a very high rate. As a result, the available bandwidth of the network gets exhausted, system crashes and performance degrade. On the other hand, the SYN flood also consumes server resources by exploiting TCP-three-way handshake. This attack is initiated by sending repeated SYN packets to the target machine until server crashes/ malfunctions. The UDP-Lag attack is that kind of attack that disrupts the connection between the client and the server. This attack is mostly used in online gaming where the players want to slow down/ interrupt the movement of other players to outmaneuver them. This attack can be carried in two ways, i.e., using a hardware switch known as a lag switch or by a software program that runs on the network and hogs the bandwidth of other users. \n",
